# DAND-A/B-Test
Analyze A/B Test Results
The following project was completed as a part of the course requirements of Udacity's Data Analyst certification.

## Overview

The project was about making an  A/B testing of users conversions on an old and new wepages.

The steps fpr this project were handling mismatched condition and page assignment, hypothesis testing via bootstrapping and standard statistical tests, removing duplicate ids, and multiple regression modelling.

## Statistical Analysis

Z-core tests

Bootstrapping sampling distributions and p-value 

Logistic regression

Multiple linear regression modelling 

## Technologies Used

Jupyter Notebook Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, StatsModels,

## Key Findings

The conversion rate for the new page was not significantly greater to that for the old page
The country of the user didn't have a significant impact on the rate of conversion between the new and old page
